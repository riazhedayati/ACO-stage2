# 2017 NGACO Retrospective
04.2018

#### Business Problem: 
NGACO leadership team needs to identify areas where they can decrease costs for ACO patients. 
Lack of insight into where money is being spent.

#### Project Goal:
Using claim line level data, identify areas of high spending within specialties, particularly related to specific providers and procedures.
Create a prototype that allows for further exploration by the ACO leadership team.

#### Results:
Identified highest spending providers and procedures within each specialty group.
Found largest procedural drivers of YOY spending.
Built and delivered a prototype that allowed for interactive exploration and drilldown of high spenders.

#### Challenges/Learnings/Takeaways: 
Key data (hospital vs physician bill) is not captured in the underlying data by ISD.
